- **Mobile first** - the view must be responsive and usable on all devices (mobile & desktop)
- **Fonts** - Don't spend time on that and use a google font

- **HTML**: code the structure of the app
- **CSS**: design and position all blocks
- **JS**: when the user clicks on a key, the input should be updated (do not format the number as shown in the GIF)

We used [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) for layout, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets and [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) for JavaScript. Feel free to use tools you are comfortable with.

Show us what you can do in 6 hours top :) Spend time on your code structure and positioning your blocks. If you can impress our design team, then your job is done (*spoiler*: they will hate your code anyway).

**Bonus:** If you have time, user should be able to choose the number he wants to call from by clicking on the `Call Using` block:
